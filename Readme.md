Rustfix is a library defining useful structures that represent fix suggestions from rustc.

## Current status

Currently, rustfix is split into two crates:

- `rustfix`, a library for consuming and applying suggestions in the format that `rustc` outputs (this crate)
- `cargo-fix`, a binary that works as cargo subcommand and that end users will use to fix their code (maintained in the [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/bin/cargo/commands/fix.rs) repo).


The library (and therefore this repo) is considered largely feature-complete. This is because:
* There is no compiler or even rust-specific logic here
* New lints and suggestions come from the Rust compiler (and external lints, like [clippy]).
* `rustfix` doesn't touch the filesystem to implement fixes, or read from disk

## Installation

`cargo fix` is a built-in command in Cargo since Rust 1.29. There is no need to install it separately from crates.io.

To use the rustfix library for use in your own fix project, add it to your `Cargo.toml`.

## Using `cargo fix --edition` to transition to Rust 2021

Instructions on how to use this tool to transition a crate to Rust 2021 can be
found [in the Rust Edition Guide.](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/edition-guide/editions/transitioning-an-existing-project-to-a-new-edition.html)
